Exploring Gun Deaths In The US

The dataset is stored in guns.csv file.It contains information on gun deaths 
in the US from 2012 to 2014. Each row in the dataset represents a single fatality. 

Here's an explanation of each column:

	year -- the year in which the fatality occurred.
	month -- the month in which the fatality occurred.
	intent -- the intent of the perpetrator of the crime. This can be Suicide, Accidental, NA, Homicide, or Undetermined.
	police -- whether a police officer was involved with the shooting. Either 0 (false) or 1 (true).
	sex -- the gender of the victim. Either M or F.
	age -- the age of the victim.
	race -- the race of the victim. Either Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American/Native Alaskan, Black, Hispanic, or White.
	hispanic -- a code indicating the Hispanic origin of the victim.
	place -- where the shooting occurred. Has several categories, which you're encouraged to explore on your own.
	education -- educational status of the victim. Can be one of the following:
	1 -- Less than High School
	2 -- Graduated from High School or equivalent
	3 -- Some College
	4 -- At least graduated from College

the victims.

Steps:

First:
	Read file and explore its structure.
Second:
	Explore dataset then try to find some pattern.
Third:
